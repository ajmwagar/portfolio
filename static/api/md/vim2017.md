ViM is a text editor from 1991, which has a huge following. 
Many people still use it today, over more modern IDE options.

The main thing about ViM, is that it is a **text editor**. Not an IDE. 

A text editor does just that, it edits text. While a full one IDE has many
more features than a text editor.
